### 1. Intro
Cybersecurity programming can use a variety of programming languages. In this learning project we will delve into the use of PowerShell, BASH and Python, as required.

### 2. Headings
(09/15/24) We have used PowerShell to perform different Cybersecurity tasks, so far. Including:
  - **Hash-based API query**
  - **Hidden files review**
  - **Computer resources usage display**
  - **Information about last logins**
  - Menu (main.ps1) for easy access to these custom PowerShell modules.
  - Scripts (.ps1) for individual use are also attached. 

(09/29/24) We have used GNU Bash to perform different Cybersecurity tasks, so far. Including:
  - **SSH Honeypot**  
    This script uses netcat and netstat to listen for connections and filter them.
  - **Scanning ports and vulnerabilities**  
    This script uses nmap for port and vulnerability scanning. 
  - Note that each script contains a menu to guide the handling of the script. 

(10/21/24) We have used Python to perform different Cybersecurity tasks, so far. Including:
  - **Scan vulnerabilities for websites**  
    *web_scanning.py* uses [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) and [ZAP API](https://pypi.org/project/zaproxy/) to scanning vulnerabilities from websites. 
  - **Check open ports - SHODAN**  
    *open_ports.py* uses Shodan API to scan an IP and returns the open ports of that IP. 
  - **Use IP Abuse Database**  
    *ip_inspector.py* uses IP Abuse Database API and checks how reliable and trusted is the given IP.
  - **Scanning IP addreses - NMAP**  
    *ip_scanning.py* uses nmap to scan the most common vulnerabilities for a given IP address.
  - **Reporting IP addresses**  
    *report_ip.py* uses IP Abuse Database API to report the compromised IP that nmap (based on *ip_scanning.py*) returns with vulnerabilities.

### 3. Project targets
Apply the learning about PowerShell, BASH and Python to create scripts that perform cybersecurity tasks.
