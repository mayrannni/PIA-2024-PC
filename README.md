(09/15/24) We have used Powershell to perform different Cybersecurity tasks, so far. Including:
  - **Hash-based API query**
  - **Hidden files review**
  - **Computer resources usage display**
  - **Information about last logins**
And a menu (main.ps1) for easy access to these custom PowerShell modules. Scripts (ext .ps1) for individual use are also attached. 

### c) Project targets
Apply the learning about PowerShell, BASH and Python to create scripts that perform cybersecurity tasks.
